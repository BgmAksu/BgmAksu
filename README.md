# Hi, I'm Begüm 👋

💻 Backend Developer | 🔐 Cyber Security Background | 🇳🇱 Based in the Netherlands

Backend Developer with experience in PHP and Python, and a strong background in Cyber Security.

I enjoy building APIs, working with databases, and creating clean, maintainable backend services.  
Previously worked as a Cyber Security Researcher at TÜBİTAK, which gave me a security-first mindset in software development.
